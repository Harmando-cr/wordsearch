# wordsearch

wordsearch is a javascript project that finds more than one sequence of four letters
equal, obliquely, horizontally or vertically in a matrix

## Installation

use npm to install all the requirements on the root directory

```bash
npm install 
```

## Usage

For local enviroments use node.

```bash
node index.js
```
this will run on port 3000.

The project has two endopoints

first we have the service "/mutant/" where it is possible to detect if a matrix 
has more than one sequence of four letter, via HTTP POST with a Json which has the
next format:

```
POST â†’ /mutant/
{
"dna":["ATGCGA", "CAGTGC", "TTATGT", "AGAAGG", "CCCCTA", "TCACTG"]
}
```

in case you have more than one sequence, it should return an HTTP 200-OK (True), otherwise a
403-Forbidden (False)

The second is the GET service "/stats" that returns a Json with the statistics of the verifications of the matrices: {"count_mutant_dna":40, "count_human_dna":100, "ratio":0.4}.

"count_mutant_dna" for more than one sequence, "count_human_dna" for the other case.

This services also has been deployed in a firebase serve, so you can do your request to:
```
https://us-central1-xmen-f6db2.cloudfunctions.net/api/mutant

https://us-central1-xmen-f6db2.cloudfunctions.net/api/stats
```

To can save and get data on firestore we need the config enviroment and credetials to firebase. So, you can request the '/mutant' POST service without persist the data. And you cannot request the '/stats' GET service.

Please use the link of service given above.

## Test

Some load tests were performed, however they were limited by the firebase quotas for the free plan.

After a quantity, the firebase server limit the request.

You can do this test tiping
```bash
artillery run artillery.yml
```


### Something Else

On the index file, you can find a function named 'generateDNA', this will create a random square matrix 
with the length of you provide it in the parameter. Was made to test the pricipal function with large matrices
